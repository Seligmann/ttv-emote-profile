[2022-02-22 01:05:30 UTC] Twolegz: "One of the most popular Fitbit models is the Fitbit Charge 2. In a study conducted by researchers at Aberystwyth University, the researchers wanted to know exactly how accurate the Fitbit Charge 2 was. In their studies, they found that the tracker was incredibly accurate when measuring calories burned while running. The Fitbit underestimated the calorie burn by just 4%, which is impressive."

[2022-02-22 04:53:39 UTC] WickedDemiurge: gay_sheriff in America? I think it's less gender biased than you think. We don't have a gender selective abortion problem like China, for example. And people are a little dismissive of women, but that doesn't compare to actual systemic oppression like in the crim. justice system. Black women who commit the same crime as a white man have a massive advantage, which is counter-intuitive to people with unnuanced understandings of gender.

In order to have your question answered you must ask your question with a link to a hot 2D anime girl/boy depending on your preference. If the artwork is to Gojo's liking he will answer your question, however if Gojo finds the artwork to be subpar he will give you a troll answer and you wont know it. Good luck!

[2022-02-22 06:58:17 UTC] Dunebug: Pengukeks Contrary to common belief, the pyramids were not built using slave labor. Later on in Egyptian history, slaves were used to construct temples and other structures, but during the golden age of pyramids, these buildings were the efforts of Egyptian citizens.
[2022-02-22 06:58:18 UTC] Pengukeks: Dunebug and what does payment mean? getting a serving of oatmeal and water? slaves usually get paid in some form
[2022-02-22 06:58:19 UTC] Dunebug: Pengukeks Because of the pharaoh’s godlike status, pyramid construction was regarded as holy work, and it was an honor to participate. We know how the workers felt from the inscriptions they left behind. The work crews chose names for themselves like “the king’s favorites” and “the hard-working gang.”

In order to have your question answered you must ask your question with a link to a hot 2D anime girl/boy depending on your preference. If the artwork is to Gojo's liking he will answer your question, however if Gojo finds the artwork to be subpar he will give you a troll answer and you wont know it. Good luck!
